# Employee Training Dashboard

#3 Project Overview
The Power BI Employee Training Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to track and visualize employee training attendance and performance metrics. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as team-wise attendance, manager-wise attendance, gender distribution, and job level-wise distribution. It helps in understanding training participation and identifying areas for improvement.

<li><b>Microsoft Power BI:</b> For data visualization and dashboard creation.</li>

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation
<li>Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.</li>
<li>Converting date columns to appropriate date formats.</li>
<li>Ensuring consistency in categorical variables (e.g., standardizing job level names).</li>
<li>Removing any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.</li>
<li>Creating calculated columns and measures as needed for the analysis.</li>

## Key Insights
<li><b>Team-wise Attendance:</b> Identified the teams with the highest and lowest attendance rates.</li>
<li><b>Manager-wise Attendance:</b> Analyzed attendance distribution among different managers to identify patterns.</li>
<li><b>Gender-wise Attendance:</b> Compared attendance rates between male and female employees.</li>
