# Employee Training Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Power BI Employee Training Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to track and visualize employee training attendance and performance metrics. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects such as team-wise attendance, manager-wise attendance, gender distribution, and job level-wise distribution. It helps in understanding training participation and identifying areas for improvement.

## Problem Statement
<li>Tracks the total number of employees enrolled in training programs.</li>
<li>Monitors attendance status (present and absent) across different teams and managers.</li>
<li>Analyzes gender-wise and job level-wise attendance distribution.</li>
<li>Provides actionable insights to improve training participation and effectiveness.</li>

## Tools Used
<li><b>Microsoft Excel:</b> For initial data collection, cleaning, and preparation.</li>
<li><b>Microsoft Power BI:</b> For data visualization and dashboard creation.</li>

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation
<li>Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.</li>
<li>Converting date columns to appropriate date formats.</li>
<li>Ensuring consistency in categorical variables (e.g., standardizing job level names).</li>
<li>Removing any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.</li>
<li>Creating calculated columns and measures as needed for the analysis.</li>

## Key Insights
<li><b>Team-wise Attendance:</b> Identified the teams with the highest and lowest attendance rates.</li>
<li><b>Manager-wise Attendance:</b> Analyzed attendance distribution among different managers to identify patterns.</li>
<li><b>Gender-wise Attendance:</b> Compared attendance rates between male and female employees.</li>
<li><b>Job Level-wise Attendance:</b> Evaluated how attendance rates vary across different job levels.</li>

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

<li><b>Targeted Training Programs:</b> Focus on teams and managers with lower attendance rates to understand barriers and improve participation.</li>
<li><b>Incentive Programs:</b> Introduce incentives for teams and managers to boost attendance and engagement.</li>
<li><b>Regular Monitoring:</b> Implement regular monitoring of attendance data to quickly identify and address any emerging issues.</li>
<li><b>Customized Training:</b> Tailor training programs to meet the specific needs of different job levels and genders to increase relevance and participation.</li>

## Conclusion
The Power BI Employee Training Dashboard provides valuable insights into employee training participation and effectiveness. By leveraging the power of data visualization, organizations can make informed decisions to enhance their training programs and ensure higher employee engagement and development.
